# FPS Booster - README
Overview
FPS Booster is a lightweight software designed to optimize your gaming performance by increasing the frame rate per second (FPS) of your games. Using advanced resource management and system optimization techniques, it ensures smoother gameplay, reduced latency, and an enhanced overall gaming experience.

How Does It Work?
1. System Resource Reallocation
FPS Booster dynamically reallocates system resources (CPU, GPU, and RAM) by prioritizing the active game over background applications. This reduces resource contention, ensuring your game gets the power it needs.

Identifies and minimizes processes that consume excessive resources.
Allocates more CPU threads to the game, depending on the processor's capabilities.
Activates dedicated GPU optimization for better rendering performance.
2. Graphics Optimization
The software fine-tunes your graphics settings for an optimal balance between quality and performance.

Adjusts game resolution and detail levels in real-time based on system performance.
Applies advanced texture compression and shader optimization.
Enables adaptive frame pacing to minimize stuttering and screen tearing.
3. Network Latency Reduction
FPS Booster includes features to improve online gaming by reducing ping and latency:

Redirects network traffic through optimized routes.
Disables unnecessary background connections.
Prioritizes game data packets for faster communication.
4. Memory Defragmentation
Games often leave fragmented memory blocks, which can cause stuttering. FPS Booster:

Defragments system memory to reduce fragmentation.
Frees up unnecessary allocated memory in real time.
5. Power Mode Adjustment
Automatically switches your system to high-performance mode to maximize CPU and GPU frequencies.

Disables power-saving features that throttle hardware performance.
Configures energy-efficient components for peak operation during gaming.
